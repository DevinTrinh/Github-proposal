# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- A visual novel: I have a story similar to a high school shojo romance in my head, but I don't know how to draw, so I might make some cursed visual novel (i.e. Amongus visual novel or Genshin visual novel that only I understand)

- Snake: Just a regular game of snake with a twist (i.e. mulitple objects on the feild or randomly genrating blocks the player cannot hit)

- Pokedex (my life was nothing but Pokemon when I was little lol): For this idea, I want the user to input a pokemon from gen 6 (because I refuse to do the whole Pokedex and gen 6 has the least amount of Pokemon), and it shows the Pokemon name, dex number, official art, weight, height, and pokedex entry.

- text adventure game: It might be something like an escape room, but I don't know what to write yet.

- Genshin Gacha simulator: For context, let's pull on the standard gacha. The user has a chance of getting a 3 star weapon (the most common), a 4 star weapon/character, or a 5 star weapon/character (the rarest). For every ten summons without a four/five star weapon/character, you are garunteed at least a four star character/weapon on the tenth summon. The user can input one summon or ten summons, and the simulator will give the user the results of the summon.
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Currently, I am working alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

If I do make a visual novel, are there any free assets in the public domain I can borrow like sprites and backgrounds?
