After School: One shot visual novel

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've created sprites using free sprite assets, downloaded some backgrounds, have two in a half scenes finished, and have one ending.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to write a good ending and finish the scene I'm currently working on. Also it might be nice to find audio since my whole visual novel is just silent, but I think that will be an after thought rather than a main priority since I want to finish the story before I add audio into the visual novel.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I originally had a story in mind, so I coded some of it in, but then I realized one, I didn't like the story, and two, it might be too much for the time span, so I decided to scrape that story and just focus on one person rather than multiple people.
